# Practical intelligence

- It's super important to use random Latin/French terms in the introductory sentence to ensure that no one understands what you are trying to say
- Yada yada technical skills are not all you need anymore
- Outsoucing, offshoring &xrarr; reduce costs while leveraging IT
- Interpersonal skills are important yo


- Very little systematic research to conceptualise and measure interpersonal/soft skills
- "Practical intelligence" = soft skills &xrarr; managerial, intapersonal, and interpersonal skills that are used to resolve IT-related work problems


> [...] the problems faced in everyday work life often have little relation to the knowledge or skills aquired through formal education [...]

> [...] we propose a taxonomy of IT practical intelligence comprising four dimensions: managing tasks; managing career; managing self; and managing others.

- Managing tasks = obtaining domain knowledge in IT
- Managing career = understanding how existing assignments fit into the larger context of the entire career
- Managing self = maximising one's productivity through self-awareness and understanding self-motivation
- Managing others = being aware of the varying interests, motivations, knowledge levels, and skills of subordinates in a team, as well as keeping tabs on outsourcing/contracting efforts


- Everything is awesome &#9835;
- Experienced IT professionals generated significantly more responses than novices
- Experienced IT professionals took significantly less time per response to complete each incident compared to novices
- Experienced IT professionals generated responses that were rated significantly higher in quality compared to responses generated by novices


> In totality, we find that experienced IT professionals performed better than novices by providing a significantly larger repertoire of responses, taking significantly less time in generating thie larger repertoire, and providing responses that were of significantly higher quality.

_No shit, Sherlock_

- SSIT can be included as part of structured interview processes
- The expert panel's response becomes a corporate library of knowledge


- No one has performed this useless experiment on other parts of the organisation
- We just had to put something here to get the paper published
- Geography and culture matters
- _Which is the most effective way to develop IT practical intelligence?_
